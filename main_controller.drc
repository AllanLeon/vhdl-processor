WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cb_alu<0> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cb_pc<0> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cb_out<1> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   mux_addr_bus/addr_bus_cmp_eq0000 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cb_mbr<1> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cb_alua<1> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net cb_alub<1> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net io/next_state_not0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net io/dout_or0000 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
